##WHAT ELSE DOES IT MEAN?

stuck
The word *“stuck,”* in this podcast, means to have something that’s difficult to
remove. It can be something physical, like a sticker or a body part: “My foot got
stuck in the hole and I couldn’t get it out.” We can also use stuck to mean having
difficulty getting out of a situation: “Because I don’t have enough training, I’m

stuck in a low-paying job,” or “I promised to help my friend and I got stuck helping
move all weekend.”

take it
In this podcast, the phrase *“take it”* means to tolerate something: “My neighbor’s
TV is on all day and I can’t take it anymore.” We can also use *“take it”* when we

want to make clear something that’s uncertain: “I take it that we need to arrive by
7:45 if we want to see the 8:00 movie,” or “I take it you’ll read the instructions
before trying put together the new desk, right?” It is similar to “I understand
that…”



##CULTURE NOTE


People often play practical jokes at work. They sometimes play jokes because
they are bored or want to make fun of other people. In some companies, there is
a *“culture”* of playing jokes on the other employees. Many people expect it and
aren’t bothered by it. In other companies, playing these kind of practical jokes is
considered inappropriate or wrong.


Some common practical jokes in a business office include hiding something from
someone, putting signs on someone’s back without the person knowing, taking
off a part of someone's clothing, or using a squirt gun to shoot water at someone.
(A squirt gun is a small plastic toy in the shape of a gun that shoots water.)
Practical jokes can also include telling someone a false story in order to get them
to do something. Perhaps the most famous type of practical joke is using a

*“whoopee cushion.”* A whoopee cushion is a small pillow that makes a funny
noise when you sit on it.

One of the most common days to play a practical joke on someone is April Fools'
Day. April Fools' Day is April 1, a day traditionally that people play practical jokes
on each other.

##COMPLETE TRANSCRIPT


Welcome to English As A Second Language Podcast Number 165, “Practical
Jokes.”


This is  Episode 165. I'm your host, Dr.
Jeff McQuillan coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in
beautiful Los Angeles, CA.

Today's podcast is called *“Practical Jokes.”* Let's get started!



[start of story]

Joey: I've had it. I'm not going to take it anymore.

Rachel: What's the matter?


Joey: I'm sick and tired of being the butt of Chandler's practical jokes. One of
these days, he's really going to get someone hurt.

Rachel: Oh no! What has he done now?


Joey: I went back to my office after lunch and sat down at my desk. After about a
half hour, I got up to get some coffee. I walked out of my office and I hear
Phoebe giggling behind me.

Rachel: What was so funny?


Joey: Chandler had put a sticker on my chair that stuck to my pants when I got
up.

Rachel: What did it say?

Joey: It said, *“I'm a Red Hot Mama.”*


Rachel: That's terrible. I can see why you're mad. You may be a “Red Hot
Papa,” but definitely not a *“Red Hot Mama.”*

Joey: Very funny. One of these days, he's going to get it. I'm planning my
revenge.


[end of story]


Today's podcast is called *“Practical Jokes.”* A 'practical joke' is when you do
something to someone, usually it's something that is not very nice, and it involves
doing something physical. So, for example, you may take out the coffee in the
coffeemaker and put in tea. Or you may take someone's pen and put glue on it
so they can't open it. That would be a practical joke; nothing too serious, but

something that other people might laugh at. Well, the word *“practical,”* of course,
usually means something that is very possible to do, but a practical joke means
something that is supposed to be funny. But it’s usually funny because someone
has something negative or bad happened to them. It's very common on April
Fool's Day, on the first of April, to play practical jokes. That's the verb we use, to
*“play”* a practical joke.


Our dialogue begins with Joey saying, “I've had it. I'm not going to take it
anymore.” *“I've had it”* means I have had enough, I will not tolerate it anymore.
*“I’ve had it”* - I want no more of this. It's something you say when you are angry
about something or some situation, perhaps, that have been going on for a long
time, and then you say, *“You know what, I've had it. I've had enough.”* He says
that he's not going to take it anymore. *“To take it”* means the same as “to put up

with something.” *“To put up with something”* means that you tolerate it, that you
accept it, that you don't do anything about it. When something is wrong, when
there is a problem, sometimes you just have to put up with it, you just have to
take it. But when you say, *“I'm not going to take it anymore,”* that means you are
not going to accept the situation anymore.

Rachel asks Joey, *“What's the matter?”* And *“what’s the matter”* is the same as

*“What's wrong?”* *“What's the matter?”* is much more common, probably more
informal. *“What's the matter?”* *“What's wrong?”* Joey says, “I'm sick and tired of
being the butt of Chandler's practical jokes.” A couple of expressions there that
are common – *“I’m sick”* and *“I’m tired.”* The expression *“I'm sick and tired”* is
similar to I've had it or I've had enough. It's when you no longer want to accept a
negative situation. “I'm sick and tired of people who do not park their cars on the

street in the right way.” “I'm sick and tired of watching television every night with
the stupid shows on TV.” *“I'm sick and tired of eating hamburger everyday.”* That
means I’m not - I don't want to put up with that situation anymore.

Well, Joey is sick and tired of being the butt of Chandler's jokes. To be the “butt
of someone's joke” means you are the one who is made fun of, you are the one
that the joke is played on. Someone plays a practical joke on you, you are the

butt of the joke, you are the person who gets hurt of the joke, if you will. Well,
Joey says that, *“One of these days, he's really going to get someone hurt.”* “One
of these days” means someday. “One of these days, I'm going to go to
Montreal.” *“One of these days, I'm going to buy a new car;”* someday, but
nothing specific.

Rachel says, *“Oh no! What has he done now?,”* means he's been doing things for

a long time that are probably bad and so, when we use the expression “What has
he done now?” – meaning, he's done other things bad in the past. Joey says
that he went to his office after lunch and he sat down at his desk. To “sit down at
your desk” means you sat down in a chair next to your desk, you don't actually sit
on your desk (well, you could!). He sat down at his desk and after about a half
hour, he got up (meaning he stood up) to get some coffee. He walked out of his

office, he left his office, and he heard Phoebe giggling behind him. To *“giggle”* as
a verb, means to laugh. Usually, it means to laugh, not *“hahaha,”* but sort of
*“hm-hm-hm,”* not very loudly, often so that other people don't hear you. We,
many times, use that term also for teenagers or young children who laugh at
things, they giggle, but it can also be used for an adult. So, Phoebe is giggling
at Joey, and that is the expression *“to giggle at someone.”*


Rachel says, *“What was so funny?,”* meaning *“What is the joke?”* Joey says,
*“Chandler had put a sticker on my chair.”* A *“sticker”* is something that sticks or
stays on something. For example, little children often have stickers that they put
in books, that are different colors and different shapes. To stick to something
means to adhere something that stays on something. You can use glue, for
example, to make something stick. Well, a sticker is a piece of paper that you
put on something. People also put stickers on their car. We call those bumper

stickers, because the *“bumper”* is the front and back part of the car that you have
in case someone hits you, they hit your bumper. To *“bump”* means to hit
something. Anyway, that's a bumper sticker.

Joey says that the sticker stuck to his pants. To *“stick,”* of course, we already
know. *“Stuck”* is the irregular past participle or a past tense, as well, “it stuck to

my pants.” Rachel says, *“What did it say?”* And Joey says, “It said, 'I'm a Red Hot
Mama.'*“ Well, first of all, when we say something is “red hot,”* it's the same as
saying they're very hot, but when we say someone, a person, is red hot, we
mean they're very good looking, they're very attractive. To be *“hot”* means to be
very sexually attractive. To be *“red hot”* means to be very attractive. This
expression is usually used with the word *“mama.”* *“Mama”* is one way of saying
*“mother”* or *“mom,”* and in some parts of the United States, especially in

Southern United States, they may refer to their mothers as *“mama.”* In most
places, we just say *“mom.”* But, the use of *“mama”* here is very different. It
doesn't mean your mother, it means a very attractive girl or a very attractive
woman. So, we say, *“she's a hot mama,”* means she's very good looking girl or a
very attractive woman. However, I have to say that this is not an expression we
use anymore very commonly, and when someone does use it, like in the
dialogue, they're using it kind of as a joke, this old expression, probably from the

50's or the 60's and 70's. Of course, a man is not a red hot mama, and that's the
practical joke. Rachel says, *“That's terrible. I can see why you're mad.”* - I can
understand why you're mad. “You may be a red hot papa, but definitely not a red
hot mama.” Well, now Rachel is making a joke on Joey, making fun of Joey by
saying that he may be a red hot papa. Of course, *“papa”* is the word informally
for father, but again, it's not one that's used by most Americans. Some people

and certain parts of the country, we would just say *“Dad.”* So, red hot papa would
of course be the male part or the male equivalent of red hot mama. But that’s not
an expression…we don't use red hot papa. That's not an actual expression.
Rachel is just making a joke.

Joey says, *“Very funny.”* Of course, he doesn't mean *“very funny”* seriously.
Joey is kidding when he says, *“Oh, very funny.”* When someone says that, they

mean that what you just said is not very funny. So, Joey is saying to Rachel that
he doesn't like her joke. “Very funny. One of these days, “ Joey says again,
*“he's going to get it.“ To “get it”* actually has a couple of different meanings. It
can mean to understand something, so, *“Do you get it?”* “Yes, I get it. Yes, I
understand.” But here, it's used differently. When he says, *“He's going to get it,”*
that means, he is going to get a joke played on him or he is going to be in
trouble. The last sentence of the dialogue, Joey says, *“I'm planning my revenge.”*

*“Revenge”* is something that you do to someone who has done something bad to
you. So, if you hurt me, I'm going to get my revenge. I'm going to revenge what
you did. You can use it as a noun and as a verb. Normally, we use it as a noun:
*“I'm going to get my revenge on you.”* I'm going to do something bad to you
because you did something bad to me. So, that’s what Joey is saying here, “I'm
planning my revenge.”


Now let's listen to the dialogue this time at a native rate of speech.
