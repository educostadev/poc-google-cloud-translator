##WHAT ELSE DOES IT MEAN?


lid

container: “The lid started rattling on top of the pot, and we knew the water was
boiling.” The phrase *“to keep a lid on (something)”* means to control something
and/or to keep it secret: “Let’s keep a lid on this until the president has made a
public announcement.” The phrase *“to put a lid on (something)”* means to end

something or prevent someone from doing something: “Large medical bills put a

used to pay the doctors.” Finally, the phrase *“to take the lid off (something)”*
means to share a secret or to make something known: “Every reporter dreams of

taking the lid off of a major government scandal.”

pot

In this podcast, the word *“pot”* means a round metal container with one or two
handles and a lid, placed on a stove to cook foods that contain a lot of liquid:
“Please boil six cups of water and some salt in a large pot, and then we’ll put in
the noodles.” When talking about money, *“the pot”* refers to money that people

have collected for some purpose: “Have you put any money in the pot to buy him
a retirement gift?” The phrase *“to go to pot”* means to fall apart or to become

This whole neighborhood is going to pot.” Finally, the word *“pot”* can refer to

marijuana: *“Is it common for high school students to smoke pot?”*


##CULTURE NOTE


Stone Soup

*“Stone Soup”* is a *“folk story”* (an old story that is shared among many

generations, especially orally) in which a hungry traveler arrives at a town and
begins to cook by placing a *“stone”* (rock) in a pot with some water, bringing it to
a boil over a fire. The *“townspeople”* (the people who live in the town) watch him

with *“curiosity”* (with interest, wanting to learn more) as he says things like, “This
would be even better with a carrot,” or “It’s delicious, but an onion would really
bring out the flavor.” And, one at a time, the townspeople bring those items, so
that in the end they have a delicious pot of soup and everyone shares it.


In 1947, the story was written as a children’ book *“of the same name”* (also called
*“Stone Soup”*) by Marcia Brown. In that version, the story was about soldiers who
were *“tricking”* (making someone do something that he or she would not normally

do) *“villagers”* (people who live in a village) into giving them food.

Stone Soup is also a magazine that *“features”* (shows; highlights) artwork,

poems, and stories that have been created by children. It was first published in
1973 and it is still published today.

The concept of *“stone soup”* now has a larger meaning and can refer to anything

made with the small contributions of many people. For example, “Dungeon Crawl
Stone Soup” is a computer game that was made from the contributions of many
different *“coders”* (programmers).

On this episode, we have a dialogue between Charlotte and Mohamed about
making a certain kind of food: soup, and a thick kind of soup called a stew. Let’s
get started.




[start of dialog]




Charlotte: Mmm, something smells good.

Mohamed: Hey, put down that lid!


Charlotte: Sorry, I just wanted to see what you’re making.

Mohamed: I’m making chicken soup.


Charlotte: I’m really in the mood for a hearty stew. There’s nothing more
appetizing on a cold day than a good stew.


Mohamed: Right, well, this is a simple chicken soup with a clear stock and
vegetables.

Charlotte: All you would have to do is thicken the soup and let it simmer a little

longer. Then, presto! You have a stew.

Mohamed: I get it. You’re partial to thick soups, but I feel like making a simple
chicken soup. I don’t have time to cook a stew in a slow cooker, which is how I

usually make it, not in a pot.

Charlotte: All right, all right. Oh, a nice purée or bisque would be nice too.
Doesn’t a chowder sound good right now? I could really go for a nice bowl of
chowder.


Mohamed: Fine, we’ll have chowder for dinner tomorrow.

Charlotte: Really?


Mohamed: Yes, and it’ll be the best chowder you’ve ever tasted – that comes out
of a can.



[end of dialog]


We begin our dialogue with Charlotte saying to Mohamed, “Mmm, something

smells good.” *“Mmm”* is a sound that we make sometimes in English for
something that looks good or, usually, smells and or tastes good. When you see
someone preparing food or you smell good food, you might go “Mmm, that smells
delicious” – that smells like something I would really want to eat. You would

never do that, for example, in my kitchen when I’m cooking.

Mohamed isn’t very happy with Charlotte. Charlotte seems to be in Mohamed’s
kitchen, because we hear him respond to Charlotte by saying, “Hey, put down

that lid!” A *“lid”* (lid) is the top of a pot or pan that you use for cooking. “To put
something down” means to put it back down where it was. So we can guess that
Charlotte has taken the top or the lid off of the pan where Mohamed is looking
something in order to smell it or to taste it. Charlotte says, “Sorry, I just wanted to

see what you’re making.” Charlotte wanted to see what Mohamed was cooking.

Mohamed says, *“I’m making chicken soup.”* *“Soup”* (soup), as you probably
know, is a food that has some sort of sauce or liquid as the base or as the main

ingredient – the main part of the food. Usually you put things into soup like
noodles or, in this case, chicken. Soup is almost always eaten with a spoon, at
least in the United States. There are some soups that you might drink and eat
without a spoon. You might just lift the bowl up and drink it, but usually you eat

soup with a spoon.

Charlotte says, *“I’m really in the mood for a hearty stew.”* A *“stew”* (stew) is a
special kind of soup that’s very thick. It has typically a lot of meat and/or

vegetables in it. Usually it takes a long time to prepare a stew. The adjective
*“hearty”* (hearty), when used with food, describes something that is very thick,
filling, and satisfying. Something that is hearty is usually something that, after you
eat it, you won’t feel hungry again for a long time.


Charlotte says, “There’s nothing more appetizing on a cold day than a good
stew.” When we describe food as *“appetizing”* (appetizing), we mean it’s

appealing. It makes you want to eat it. Mohamed says, “Right, well, this is a
simple chicken soup with a clear stock and vegetables.” Mohamed is saying that
he’s not making a stew. He instead is making “a simple chicken soup with a clear
stock.”


*“Stock”* (stock) has a couple of different meanings in English. Here, when we’re
talking about food, it means a clear liquid that is made usually by boiling meat,
vegetables, and perhaps a few other ingredients. You could have a chicken

stock, which would be liquid that comes from putting a big chicken (or a little
chicken) into a pot of boiling water. You get rid of the chicken, and what you have
left is this liquid that has a chicken taste. We would call that *“chicken stock.”*


You can do the same thing with other kinds of meat, with fish or with vegetables,
or some combination of those things. The idea of a stock is that it doesn’t have
anything hard or solid in it; it’s just the liquid. Mohamed is using a “clear (clear)

stock.” A clear stock would be a stock that doesn’t have a lot of color. “Chicken
stock” is usually a clear stock. Charlotte says, “All you would have to do is
thicken the soup and let it simmer a little longer. Then, presto! You have a stew.”


Charlotte is suggesting to Mohamed how he could change his soup, his clear
stock soup, into a stew. She says, *“All you would have to do is thicken the soup.”*
*“To thicken”* (thicken) food means, not surprisingly, to make something thicker,
especially by adding either flour or another ingredient called cornstarch. You can

thicken soups in a number of different ways. You can even use egg yolk – the
inside of an egg, a raw egg, uncooked egg – to chicken soup, or at least that’s
what I read in a cookbook once.


*“To simmer”* (simmer) means to boil something at a very low heat. The water or
the liquid in the pan is boiling, but it isn’t boiling very rapidly. We would say it’s
not a *“full boil.”* It is bubbling. You can see the bubbles on the top of the surface,
but it’s all being done at a very low heat. Charlotte explains that stews are

typically prepared, or made, by simmering the liquid for a long time.

She says, *“Then, presto! You have a stew.”* *“Presto”* (presto) is a word we use to
indicate that something has happened very quickly, even magically. *“Presto”*

comes from the Italian, meaning quick or fast or rapid. We sometimes use that
term in music, when talking about music that goes quickly or rapidly – but more
generally, the word is used to describe something that happens very quickly, and
that’s what Charlotte is using the word here to mean.


Mohamed says, *“I get it,”* meaning yes, I understand. *“You’re partial,”* he says, “to
thick soups.” *“To be partial (partial) to”* something means to prefer something.

Some men are partial to blondes – they like women who have blonde hair. Some
people are partial to brunettes – women who have dark or brown hair. Some
people are partial to beer; if they want to drink something with alcohol in it, they
drink beer. Some people are partial to wine – they have a preference for wine,

and so forth. Charlotte is partial to stews, to thick soups.

Mohamed says, however, “I feel like making a simple chicken soup. I don’t have
time to cook a stew in a slow cooker, which is how I usually make it, not in a pot.”

A *“slow cooker”* is a special kind of cooking machine, an electric machine that
cooks food very slowly for many hours at a time. A more common term for a slow
cooker is a *“crock (crock) pot.”*


Many people have crock pots that they use to cook food for a very long period of
time. Some people put food into the crock pot in the morning before they go to
work, and when they come home later in the day, the food is done. It’s been

cooking slowly the whole day. That particular kind of cooking machine is called a
*“slow cooker”* or a *“crock pot.”*

Mohamed usually makes stews in a crock pot, he says, not in a pot. A *“pot”* (pot)

here refers to a metal container, something you cook with that is put on top of
some source of heat, usually a stove, and is used to cook things like soup. *“Pot”*
has a number of different meanings in English. *“Pot”* can also refer to marijuana,
that you smoke. You have to be very careful which kind of pot you use in the

kitchen. Do you want to prepare some food, or do you want something else to
happen?

Charlotte says, *“All right, all right.”* She is saying that yes, she understands that

Mohamed doesn’t want to make her stew. She then says, “Oh, a nice purée or
bisque would be nice too.” A *“purée”* (purée) is a smooth and creamy soup or
other kind of food that is made by putting food usually into a special machine
called a *“blender”* (blender). You might make a vegetable purée, when you take

vegetables and you chop them up into very small pieces by putting them in this
special kind of machine that chops up and blends food, called a *“blender.”*

Charlotte says, *“Oh, I would also like soup that is a purée or a bisque”* (bisque). A

*“bisque”* is a creamy, thick soup. We often make lobster bisque, which is a thick
soup made with the meat of a lobster. Charlotte says, “Doesn’t a chowder sound
good right now?” A *“chowder”* (chowder) is another kind of thick soup, a stew that
is usually made with seafood, potatoes, milk, and/or cream. A very common kind
of chowder in the U.S. is *“clam (clam) chowder.”* A *“clam”* is a kind of shellfish.


Charlotte says, *“I could really go for a nice bowl of chowder.”* *“To go for”*
something means to really want to do something or to have something. When
we’re talking about food, it’s something that you would really want to eat. “I could

go for a nice big doughnut” – I feel like eating a nice big doughnut. I always feel
like eating a nice big doughnut, but if I ate doughnuts every time I felt like eating
doughnuts, I would be 500 pounds and not very healthy.


Anyway, Mohamed says, *“Fine, we’ll have chowder for dinner tomorrow.”* He’s
telling Charlotte that he will make a thick soup, a chowder, for her – not today,
but tomorrow. Charlotte says, *“Really?”* Mohamed says, “Yes, and it’ll be the best

chowder you’ve ever tasted – that comes out of a can. Mohamed is saying yes,
we’ll have chowder tomorrow, but I’m not going to make the chowder – I’m going
to just buy a can of soup prepared already from the store and give you that.


Of course, soup from a can never as good – almost never – as soup from your
own kitchen, soup that you prepare. Mohamed is not saying that he’s going to
cook Charlotte some chowder. He instead is saying he’s just going to buy a can

of chowder and give her that – which is not very nice, Mohamed, really. But then
again, if Charlotte really wants chowder, she can learn how to cook herself and
make her own soup.


Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
